# Customer Segmentation

  This project aims at analyzing the content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by âˆ¼ 4000 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09). Based on this analysis, then developing a model that allows to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year and this, from its first purchase.

## Processing

  1. Data preparation
  
  2. Exploring the content of variables
  
  3. Insight on product categories
  
  4. Customer categories
  
  5. Classifying customers
  
  6. Testing the predictions
